# PhotoFinder
Individual final project for CS 5610: Web Development at Northeastern University. Based on the learning of completing [Kanbas Project](https://github.com/Jerrybaoyilei/kanbas-react-web-app).

This website provides people with relevant information to take stunning photos at both their familiar places and new areas. 

Although users can see photos when they click on a specific location on Google Maps, the experience is not really optimized for photography. 

Some photos are stunning results from photographers, whereas others are more average and simply show what the place looks like. More importantly, for experienced photographers, there is no way to find information crucial to taking a good photo –– lighting information, for example –– by looking up a location on Google Maps. Such information, provided with some guidance on how to reading them, is even more crucial for non-enthusiasts to take a stunning photo with their phone cameras. 

This web project intend to add an additional information layer to maps, specifically focusing on helping users take good photos. Example information can include the sunlight direction and strength at a particular time, availability of landmarks nearby, potential for meteorological phenomena that can possibly lead to one-of-a-kind captures. 

ReactJS and BootStrap will be the main tech stacks used for the front-end development. Express.JS and Node.JS will be used for the server side of the project. MongoDB is the database of choice. Google Maps API and a weather API will be used as well. (The list of tech stacks is subject to change as the project develops)
